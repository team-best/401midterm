# Project - "Music Guessing Game"

# Project Idea - Node Backend Application

  * Create an app that will allow a user to guess the correct title and artist from a snippet of a song. The user can guess the artist of the song. If the user failed to answer correctly, the app will give the user the correct answer.

**Game Description**

User can Sign in or Sign up to be added to the database.
After you Sign in successfully, enter your name into available name entry on the Terminal.
Once you are signed in choose either "a", "b" or "c" Based on the music you heard.
When you select your choice type either "a", "b" or "c" to see your result.
If you failed to answer correctly you will be prompted to guess the artist name again.
